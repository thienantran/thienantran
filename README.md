## Hi I am Teddy 🐻

I used to play a lot of video games like Counter Strike and Valorant. I got to play internationally and infront of some big audiences. Playing video games really shaped my mind and gave me some extremely important life skills. These games instilled into me the ideas that success comes one round at a time, and that with time, focus, and intentional actions you will reach your goal.

"Ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness" 
My interpretation of this is that any skill or topic can be learned, it just takes time.

I hacked and jailbroke some AI models. I've been mainly focusing on learning the contents for Cyber/Information Security engineering recently.
Currently i'm at Northrop Grumman as a Systems Engineer Intern. 

Goal: To become a potato farmer.
